Subject: [PATCH 26/26] Revert part of https://bugs.python.org/issue33895
 https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4860f01ac0f07cdc8fc0cc27c33f5a64e5cfec9f

LIEF crashes because Python code gets called from its static initialization code (CreateModule2 gets called, more?)

So we disable some of this commit and add a new env. var CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_DROP_GIL_AS_PER_UPSTREAM
to revert to upstream's decision here.

There really isn't any way to get the ProcAddress without allowing static initialization to happen and
for LIEF, that calls back into Python. It is unclear why this isn't a problem for other extension modules.
This could be an issue with LIEF too, of course.

Pinging @tonyroberts, @romainthomas and @zooba for your thoughts.

This issue has been a bit of a nightmare for me. In the process I did make great strides making our CPython
more debuggable which should pay off in future.
